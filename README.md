So far I have hooked up an API endpoint that requires a key to submit a potential new client lead. 
There is validation and middleware to check for the key and to validate all fields. 
The lead is saved in MongoDB.
The owner of the form gets a text message with the form info, and a phone number to the potential client formatted pretty.
TODO:
Hook up autoresponding email to potential client and lead them into click funnel incase follow up call fails or is not initiated.
